## Description

The MERLIN corpus is a written learner corpus for Czech, German, and 
Italian that has been designed to illustrate the Common European 
Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) with authentic learner data. 
The corpus contains learner texts produced in standardized language 
certifications covering CEFR levels A1-C1. The MERLIN annotation scheme 
includes a wide range of language characteristics that provide 
researchers with concrete examples of learner performance and progress 
across multiple proficiency levels.
